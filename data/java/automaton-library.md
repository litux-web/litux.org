My fork of `automaton` Java Library is at [github.com/davipt/automaton](https://github.com/davipt/automaton/tree/davipt).

The fork contains performance optimizations for high volume multi-threaded applications, in particular with certain regular expressions what would enter into a dead-loop cycle.
