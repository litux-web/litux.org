> TinyRadius is a simple, small and fast Java Radius library capable of sending and receiving Radius packets of all types. It is released under the terms of the LGPL.

My fork of `TinyRadius` Java Library is at [github.com/davipt/TinyRadius](https://github.com/davipt/TinyRadius).

The fork contains [performance optimizations](https://github.com/davipt/TinyRadius/compare/rel-1.0.0...master) for high volume multi-threaded applications, in particular some fixes for vendor specific radius attributes.

The original site for TinyRadius is at [tinyradius.sourceforge.net](https://tinyradius.sourceforge.net) and developed by Matthias Wuttke.
