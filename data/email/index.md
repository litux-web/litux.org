An excellent tool to verify many of these security features is the [Anti.Phishing Domain Verification](https://anti.phishing.pt/pt/domain_verify/domain_verification) tool from [AnubisNetworks](https://www.anubisnetworks.com):
> Domain Verify is a free tool by Mailspike.
> This tool allows you to check well known systems related to a Domain.
> Systems include DMARC and TLS Reporting, as well as many more.
> The primary goal of this tool is to raise awareness on the terrible Phishing attacks every organization suffers regularly.
