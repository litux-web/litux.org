{{{image:voidasterisk/voidtiles_1.png:Void Tiles}}} A simple cube puzzle game for kids between one and three years.

See how kids grow fast, first by randomly touching everywhere with the whole hands (shall I say “smashing the screen”), and later touching each piece with their tiny fingers.

Multi-touch enabled (they always hold the device with a finger on the screen). Drag enabled (drag the finger around the screen for faster hiding/showing tiles). Motion enabled (shake to shuffle, shake twice to unshuffle)

Clear all tiles to pick a new photo from the device’s photo albums.

iPad/iPhone/iPod compatible.

Change the number of pieces on the settings (2x2 to 10x10 pieces).

Note: iOS apps should not be a replacement for real physical toys!

Compatible with all iOS devices.
