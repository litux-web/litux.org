Today my [Vodafone live!cast](vodafone-live-cast) project was also announced in [Vodafone Portugal](https://www.vodafone.pt): “Vodafone lança informação gratuita em rodapé no ecrã do telemóvel (21 Junho 2006)“.

> Vodafone Ticker (previously known as “live!cast” (…)) was announced last year (in Germany), and is probably inside your own device, but not yet enabled by your operator. It was the next big thing, the “RSS for mobiles” some said.
