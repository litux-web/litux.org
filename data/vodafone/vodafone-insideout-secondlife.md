{{{image:vodafone/vodafone-insideout-secondlife.jpeg:Vodafone InsideOut SecondLife}}} The cat is out of the bag! [Vodafone InsideOut](https://web.archive.org/web/20080418100131/http://secondlife.vodafone.com/) on [SecondLife](https://secondlife.com).

* You know what it’s like. You’re chatting to your robot friend whilst skydiving from a floating marshmallow castle when you realise you’re late for work.
* Wouldn’t it be great if your second life didn’t have to end where your first life begins?
* We think so too, so we created Vodafone InsideOut. It lets you call and text between Second Life and the real world. The Beta service is live, so you can try it out now.

As stated on the [Vodafone InsideOut website](https://web.archive.org/web/20080418125800/http://secondlife.vodafone.com/cost.aspx)…
> **What does it cost?**
> The phone itself is free: to get your hands on one, just register on the Vodafone InsideOut island in Second Life. Any usage of Vodafone InsideOut initiated from Second Life is free-of-charge until 31st March 2008. Afterwards all messages and voice calls initiated inside Second Life may be charged up to 300 L$ per minute/message. Any usage from your mobile phone calling into Second Life is charged according to your tariff plan of your chosen telco provider.
> To protect your privacy, virtual phone numbers are assigned to your communication (so your real number is never shown to anyone). Our virtual numbers are currently taken from a pool of German numbers (starting with +49), so for now, any outgoing calls or texts from your real phone to Second Life will be charged as a call or text to Germany (or within if you are German). These costs are charged by your mobile phone provider, not Vodafone.
> Messages that you receive to your real mobile phone from Second Life will be free, unless your provider asks you to pay for receiving messages or calls (this is the case in the US, but not in most of Europe).
> Vodafone InsideOut is currently offered as a beta trial with no guarantees of full availability until 31st March 2008 Please be aware that Vodafone InsideOut cannot be supported by any Vodafone helpdesks during that beta trial.

…so this is a beta service and won’t be supported by your regular helpdesk line, so feel free to ping us on the official blog or leave a comment. (unrespectful or off-topic comments here will be deleted and prosecuted without merci)

The original post will continue to be used to collect the first handful of links pointing to our service.

##### Join us for our launch party with DJ Jenns
> Hello again.
> We’re having some fun on the Vodafone InsideOut island during our launch week (October 1st to October 7th), and we’d like you to come and join us!
> We’re hosting a launch party on Thursday October 4th. The Second Life renowned DJ Jenns will be on his decks from 18:00 - 22:00 UK time, that’s 10:00 - 14:00 Second Life time.

They’ll be hidden in new places and refreshed with new prizes everyday!  In order to redeem the prizes, you’ll need to subscribe to the service (which only takes a couple of minutes) and you can do that right here on the website.

Update 2007-10-10:

#### Issues with HUD Activation in some countries
> In a perfect world everyone would be able to communicate with everyone else, independently of technicalities like communication protocols, network formats and the standards being used.
> Unfortunately we’re not living in a perfect world.
> If you try to activate your Vodafone InsideOut HUD and never receive an SMS on your real mobile phone, or if you do receive it but the reply you sent never received another reply back, help us helping you and tell us about it.
> Please leave a comment here stating your experience. If you feel comfortable with it, leave your Second Life user name (but never leave your mobile number). Tell us as much as you can about your country and operator (e.g. is it GSM or other kind of network; what is the operator; did it fail on the first SMS or the second one; do you also have issues with mobile to mobile connectivity; etc.), so we can trace back and check the reasons.
> Currently we have an half a dozen countries with confirmed failure while delivering the SMS’s, which we’re already taking care of, but we still need your help to identify further countries or operators.
> Thanks in advance for your help.

> We’d also like to clarify some questions we’ve been having regarding the costs for using the service.
> Until November 30th when you initiate calls and text messages from within Second Life, all calls and text messages are free-of-charge - we may extend this period of free calls and texts if you’re all enjoying it, so please feedback any comments you have!
