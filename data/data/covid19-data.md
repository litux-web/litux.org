title: COVID-19 Public Data for Portugal
last-updated: 2020-09-31

The data repository at [github.com/dssg-pt/covid19pt-data](https://github.com/dssg-pt/covid19pt-data) contains all COVID-19 data that could be automatically retrieved from the Portuguese official government publications, intended for data science or just curious people to get access to a consistent and organized dataset to help analyse the data and model future changes.

I've been a contributor to the repository and [Data Science for Social Good](https://www.dssg.pt) providing my services on my "magic" to figure out ways to retrieve the source data and publish it consistently.

The repository includes many data sources, some in multiple formats when the official sources changed significantly. From cases and deaths and hospital occupancy, to test samples and positivity, to the vaccination.
The data source was used by many parties, including [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&time=2021-04-26..latest&facet=none&country=~PRT&pickerSort=asc&pickerMetric=location&Metric=Vaccine+doses&Interval=Cumulative&Relative+to+Population=true&Color+by+test+positivity=false), [Financial Times](https://ig.ft.com/coronavirus-chart/?areas=prt&areasRegional=usny&areasRegional=usnm&areasRegional=uspr&areasRegional=usaz&areasRegional=usfl&areasRegional=usnd&cumulative=0&logScale=0&per100K=1&startDate=2022-01-01&values=deaths), and even the Portuguese Government itself.
