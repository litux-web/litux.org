Samsung's second attempt at a Series 60 device (after ditching the SGH-D700 they were showing at CeBIT last year) is called the SGH-D710.

The new device makes use of the slider form factor, as opposed to the twisting clamshell design of the D700, but still makes use of an external stub antenna.

I find the presence of the antenna a bit strange considering how so many of their newer handsets no longer have one.
