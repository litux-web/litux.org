# About Litux

Bruno has been tweaking internet packets since about 1995, and had an intermittent web presence since the end of 2001, first together with friends and colleagues at [na-cama.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20011129043237/http://na-cama.com:80/) with his own [pillow](https://web.archive.org/web/20011204142930/http://na-cama.com/davi/) and at least since April 2004 at this domain, with a [tech wiki](https://web.archive.org/web/20051210201955/http://wiki.litux.org/) and a [personal blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20051223181505/http://blog.litux.org/author/davipt/).

The Internet was different back then.
